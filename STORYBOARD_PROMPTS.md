## TECHNICAL NOTES FOR AI IMAGE GENERATION

### Recommended Tools:
- **Midjourney** or **DALL-E 3** for high-quality storyboard frames
- **Stable Diffusion** with controlnet for consistent style
- Use consistent seed values or style references for visual coherence

### Prompt Modifications:
- Add "storyboard frame" or "cinematic storyboard" for more diagrammatic look
- Add "film noir lighting" for more dramatic shadows
- Add "cyberpunk 2077 aesthetic" for consistent style reference
- Add "horror film cinematography" for mood

### Aspect Ratio:
- All prompts specify 2.35:1 (cinematic widescreen)
- Can be adjusted to 16:9 if needed for web display

### Consistency Tips:
- Use same character description across all frames: "person in dark tech-wear"
- Maintain consistent lighting description: "emergency amber overhead lighting, server blue glow"
- Keep color palette consistent: "cold metallic gray surfaces"
- Use same camera terminology: "cinematic 2.35:1 aspect ratio"
